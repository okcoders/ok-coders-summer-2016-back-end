// create two random numbers between 1 and 1000 (1000 exclusive)
// if the second number is greater than the first, print (i.e console.log):
// Hey! <second number> is greater than <first number>.
// if the first number is even, print:
// <first number> is an even number!
// if the second number is odd print:
// <second number> is an odd number!
// if the first number is greater than your age print:
// you are older than me and I should respect you.
// otherwise if the first number is the same as your age print:
// what are the odds!
// otherwise print:
// you still have so much to learn.
