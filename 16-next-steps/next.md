## What do I do next?

First you must be ok with not knowing things, and realize that just because you
haven't done something before does not mean you can't do it now.

### Get to know other developers so 1) you can ask them about guidance, and 2) because a developer will have to hire you if you want to make the switch, and knowing them will sure help
1. user meetups (okc.js and others)
2. coding groups (code for okc)

### Work on side-projects and push them to github and make sure they are public (or contribute to other projects)
1. I am going to open source the county assessor stuff, so you can contribute to
   that if you like

### Specialize
1. There is way too much out there too learn and no developer is expected to
   know all of it. You may hear the term full-stack floating around, but
   basically it just means someone that has broad but probably not deep
   understanding of front-end and back-end technologies

#### Front End Specialization
web:
1. html
2. css
3. javascript
4. css framework: (bootstrap, material)
5. application framework: (angular, react)
6. http and the browser
7. regex
mobile:
1. Swift for iPhone, java for android (though knowing web tech can often be
   applied to both iPhone and android through frameworks (phonegap and others),
   so best choice in my opinion is to learn web
desktop:
1. see mobile, but slightly different - same story thought with things like atom
   electron

#### Back End Specialization
1. server-side language (so many: javascript through node, java, scala, go,
   python, ruby, lisp, c), and also understanding different general principles
   of languages like static vs. dynamic, compiled vs interpreted at run time, weak vs.
   strong, etc.
2. databases
3. terminal
4. http
5. algorithms and data structures (search, sort, stacks, hashes, trees)
6. regex
7. complexity/performance - big o notation (as I increase the size of the input,
   how does the algorithm perform?). If I go from a list of 20 to a list of
   20000, how much longer does the program take?

### Resources
1. https://www.coursera.org/, udemy, etc. there are a ton now
2. http://bigocheatsheet.com/

books:
1. the pragmatic programmer
2. structure and interpretation of computer programs
3. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read
4. Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software

Honestly, I've learned most of what I know from random blog posts and documentation

### How to get hired
1. ideally you could transition within your current company
2. otherwise you are interviewing, and the above resources should help with the
   interview. If you are interviewing make sure to have some things you can
   point to on github and ask if they have some kind of screener you can take.
   Spend a lot of time on the screener.
