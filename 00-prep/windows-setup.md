Windows Instructions
====

## Install software

Install the following software by downloading it at these urls:

If you do not already have a preferred editor, then check out [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

I will be using vim in class, but sublime is a good alternative if you are newer
to coding.

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/)

Google Chrome has excellent developer tools that we will utilize when we get
into scraping websites.

[Git Bash](http://msysgit.github.io/)

Windows does come with a built-in command prompt, but we will be using another Terminal emulator with built-in support for git, the version control software that works with GitHub. *Do not use the built-in command prompt*. Use Git Bash. Note, windows does have bash coming to it soon [Bash coming to Windows](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/be-very-afraid-hell-has-frozen-over-bash-is-coming-to-windows-10/)

## Install Node
