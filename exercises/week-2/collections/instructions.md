## Arrays and Objects

Read through each javascript file in the node directory and complete the assignments it contains. Further instructions are provided in each file. In general you will edit each file and run it from the command line using node until the output matches the instructions or all the tests are passing, e.g.

	$ node arrays.js
	test 1 passed
	test 2 failed *
	test 3 failed *
	test 4 failed *
	test 5 failed *
	test 6 failed *
	test 7 failed *
	test 8 failed *
	test 9 failed *
