OK Coders: Lesson 4 Exercises
=====

For these exercises you'll be working with the files in the source directory in this folder. There is a .js file for each section of this lesson material. Inside those you'll additional instructions.

## The JavaScript Console

You'll be logging to the console for all of these exercises. Here is more info
about the console in node - [node console](https://nodejs.org/api/console.html) (the browser also has a console object)

## Logging to the Console

Log to the console using the `console.log()` function. We haven't learned what a function is yet, but for now all you need to know is that you can write this code on its own line in your program and that whatever expression you put between the parenthesis `( ... )` will be evaluated and printed out in the console.

For example, to log a value to the console write:

```
console.log( 5 )
```

Log a more complex expression to the console:

```
console.log( 5 + 3 < 10 )
```

You can also log variables to the console, which will print out their value:

```
var name = 'Ada'
console.log( name )
```

## Exercise 1: Variables and Values

The variables.js file includes exercises to give you practice with values, expressions and variables.

## Exercise 2: Program Structure

The second set of exercises in structure.js introduces more complex statements and gives you practice with those statements and the expressions they require.
