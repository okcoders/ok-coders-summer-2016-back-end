## Week 4 homework

in the 08-mongodb/examples/client.js file there is a template for working with
mongodb inside a javascript file.

Using these guides:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb
https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/node/

Try and answer the same questions we answered during our in class exercise, but
inside a .js file using the node.js mongo drivers.
