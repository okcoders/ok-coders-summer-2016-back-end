## Week 6 exercise

1. Make sure you have gone through the quick start, guide, and api (not the
   whole api, but try to understand the structure of it) for mongoose:
   a. http://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html
   b. http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html
   c. http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html
2. Review request: https://github.com/request/request
   a. specifically, request supports posting forms and HTTP authentication
   (what you do when you sign up for a site or submit billing information,
   and what you do when you sign into a site, for example), look through the
   guide for these two things.
